# Work Done
To analyze and compare male and female employees within a company, I designed and implemented a dashboard using SQL queries, Tableau, and Excel. This dashboard not only provided insights into average salary metrics across genders but also identified managerial roles within various departments.

I began by writing SQL queries to extract and manipulate the necessary data from multiple employee databases. These queries joined tables containing employee demographics, salaries, job titles, and department information. I applied aggregate functions to compute average salaries for male and female employees at different levels and across departments. I also used filtering techniques in SQL to isolate managerial roles by identifying specific job titles and responsibilities.

After extracting the data, I exported the results into Excel for further validation and preliminary analysis. Excel allowed me to ensure data accuracy and consistency before proceeding to visualization. This step also helped in identifying outliers and preparing the data for easy integration into Tableau.

In Tableau, I transformed the data into an interactive, visually compelling dashboard. Using features like bar charts, pie charts, and cross-tab visualizations, the dashboard allowed users to compare male and female employees' average salaries across departments and job roles. It also enabled them to identify where gender disparities were more prevalent and highlighted departments with higher concentrations of male or female managers.

This comprehensive dashboard empowered stakeholders to make data-driven decisions about gender equity, employee compensation, and leadership diversity. It also provided an actionable view of how managerial roles were distributed across the company, making it easier for the organization to assess and improve diversity in leadership positions.
